# SpacedIntegers

This is my solution to the assignment Train of class software developement 1, written in Java.

More information can be seen in the comments of the source code.

### Requirements

This program consists of one class: Class **SpacedIntegers**.

#### Class SpacedIntegers

This class represents a HashSet with a minimum distance between two numbers. The numbers are collected but not sorted in a HashSet.
Every number has a minimum distance to its next number. 

Example: Minimum distance is 2. The HashSet contains [1,3,5,10]. 
We want to add the number 9 but it gets declined because 9 is to near to 10.
7 or 8 between 5 and 10 would be possible.
